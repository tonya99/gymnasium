			<p>Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14.1–18.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females.[48][49][50] The tallest recorded male was 5.88 m (19.3 ft) and the tallest recorded female was 5.17 m (17.0 ft) tall.[48][51] The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female[52] with maximum weights of 1,930 kg (4,250 lb) and 1,180 kg (2,600 lb) having been recorded for males and females, respectively.[49][50] Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short.[53]:66 Located at both sides of the head, the giraffe's large, bulging eyes give it good all-round vision from its great height.[54]:25 Giraffes see in colour[54]:26 and their senses of hearing and smell are also sharp.[20] The animal can close its muscular nostrils to protect against sandstorms and ants.[54]:27</p>

			<p>The giraffe's prehensile tongue is about 45 cm (18 in) long.[49][50] It is purplish-black in colour, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and is useful for grasping foliage, as well as for grooming and cleaning the animal's nose.[54]:27 The upper lip of the giraffe is also prehensile and useful when foraging and is covered in hair to protect against thorns. The tongue, and inside of the mouth are covered in papillae.[7]</p>

			<p>The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, or nearly black in colour[20]) separated by light hair (usually white or cream in colour[20]). Male giraffes become darker as they age.[46] The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands.[47] While adult giraffes standing among trees and bushes are hard to see at even a few metres' distance, they actively move into the open to gain the best view of an approaching predator, obviating any benefit that camouflage might bring. Instead, the adults rely on their size and ability to defend themselves. However, camouflage appears to be important for calves, which spend a large part of the day in hiding, away from their mothers; further, over half of all calves die within a year, so predation is certainly important. It appears, therefore, that the spotted coat of the giraffe functions as camouflage for the young, while adults simply inherit this coloration as a by-product.[12] The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands.[55] Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.[46]</p>

			<p>The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray.[52] Its thickness allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured.[54]:34 The fur may serve as a chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function.[56] Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs.[7] The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.[54]:36</p>

				<h2 id="three-1">Skull and ossicones</h2>
				<p>Both sexes have prominent horn-like structures called ossicones, which are formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones.[46] Being vascularized, the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation,[55] and are also used in combat between males.[57] Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top.[46] Also, a median lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges at the front of the skull.[7] Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age.[20] A giraffe's skull is lightened by multiple sinuses.[53]:70 However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat.[46] The upper jaw has a grooved palate and lacks front teeth.[54]:26 The giraffe's molars have a rough surface.[54]:27</p>

				<h2 id="three-2">Legs, locomotion and posture</h2>
				<p>The front and back legs of a giraffe are about the same length. The radius and ulna of the front legs are articulated by the carpus, which, while structurally equivalent to the human wrist, functions as a knee.[58] It appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight.[59] The foot of the giraffe reaches a diameter of 30 cm (12 in), and the hoof is 15 cm (5.9 in) high in males and 10 cm (3.9 in) in females.[54]:36 The rear of each hoof is low and the fetlock is close to the ground, allowing the foot to provide additional support to the animal's weight.[7] Giraffes lack dewclaws and interdigital glands. The giraffe's pelvis, though relatively short, has an ilium that is outspread at the upper ends.[7]</p>

				<p>A giraffe has only two gaits: walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs on one side of the body at the same time, then doing the same on the other side.[46] When galloping, the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward,[20] and the tail will curl up.[46] The animal relies on the forward and backward motions of its head and neck to maintain balance and the counter momentum while galloping.[41]:327–29 The giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to 60 km/h (37 mph),[60] and can sustain 50 km/h (31 mph) for several kilometres.[61]</p>

				<p>A giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs.[41]:329 To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its knees and spreads its hind legs to raise its hindquarters. It then straightens its front legs. With each step, the animal swings its head.[54]:31 In captivity, the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night.[62] It usually sleeps lying down, however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short "deep sleep" phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep.[62] If the giraffe wants to bend down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees.[46] Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water,[63] although they could possibly float.[64] When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony[63][64] or keep its head above the surface.[63]</p>

         <p> The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2–2.4 m (6.6–7.9 ft) in length, accounting for much of the animal's vertical height.[49][50][54]:29[65] The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over 28 cm (11 in) long.[53]:71 They comprise 52–54 per cent of the length of the giraffe's vertebral column, compared with the 27–33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe’s closest living relative, the okapi.[19] This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults.[66] The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a strengthened nuchal ligament, which are anchored by long dorsal spines on the anterior thoracic vertebrae, giving the animal a hump.[7][67]</p>
        
			<p>The giraffe's neck vertebrae have ball and socket joints.[53]:71 In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue.[54]:29 The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie between the first and second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1.[19][66] This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra.[67] However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.[19]</p>

			<p>There are several hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of elongation in giraffe necks.[57] The "competing browsers hypothesis" was originally suggested by Charles Darwin and challenged only recently. It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, such as kudu, steenbok and impala, encouraged the elongation of the neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to 4.5 m (15 ft) high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can feed up to only about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) high.[68] There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels, and giraffes feed more efficiently (gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful) high in the canopy.[69][70] However, scientists disagree about just how much time giraffes spend feeding at levels beyond the reach of other browsers,[16][57][68][71] and a 2010 study found that adult giraffes with longer necks actually suffered higher mortality rates under drought conditions than their shorter-necked counterparts. This study suggests that maintaining a longer neck requires more nutrients, which puts longer-necked giraffes at risk during a food shortage.[72]</p>

			<p>Another theory, the sexual selection hypothesis, proposes that the long necks evolved as a secondary sexual characteristic, giving males an advantage in "necking" contests (see below) to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females.[16] In support of this theory, necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age,[16][57] and the former do not employ other forms of combat.[16] However, one objection is that it fails to explain why female giraffes also have long necks.[73] It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance.[74][75]</p>

				<h2 id="three-4">Internal Systems</h2>

				<p>In mammals, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is longer than the right; in the giraffe it is over 30 cm (12 in) longer. These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal;[76] the left nerve is over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) long.[77] Each nerve cell in this path begins in the brainstem and passes down the neck along the vagus nerve, then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx. Thus, these nerve cells have a length of nearly 5 m (16 ft) in the largest giraffes.[76] The structure of a giraffe's brain resembles that of domestic cattle.[54]:31 It is kept cool by evaporative heat loss in the nasal passages.[55] The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small lung volume relative to its mass. Its long neck gives it a large amount of dead space, in spite of its narrow windpipe. These factors increase the resistance to airflow. Nevertheless, the animal can still supply enough oxygen to its tissues and it can increase its respiratory rate and oxygen diffusion when running.[78]</p>

				<p>The circulatory system of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height. Its heart, which can weigh more than 11 kg (25 lb) and measures about 60 cm (2 ft) long, must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as 7.5 cm (3.0 in).[20] Giraffes have unusually high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute.[53]:76 When the animal lowers its head the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and a rete mirabile in the upper neck, with its large cross sectional area, prevents excess blood flow to the brain. When it raises again, the blood vessels constrict and direct blood into the brain so the animal does not faint.[79] The jugular veins contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered.[80] Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them. To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight; preventing too much blood from pouring into them.[47]</p>

				<p>Giraffes have oesophageal muscles that are unusually strong to allow regurgitation of food from the stomach up the neck and into the mouth for rumination.[53]:78 They have four chambered stomachs, as in all ruminants, and the first chamber has adapted to their specialised diet.[7] The intestines of an adult giraffe measure more than 70 m (230 ft) in length and have a relatively small ratio of small to large intestine.[81] The liver of the giraffe is small and compact.[53]:76 A gallbladder is generally present during fetal life, but it may disappear before birth.[7][82][83]</p>
